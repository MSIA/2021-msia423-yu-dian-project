## Project charter

### Vision

Social media platforms have made it easier than ever for political figures and celebrities to make their voices heard. Since Donald J. Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, he has used Twitter to criticize, praise, persuade, entertain, and establish his version of events.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the former president’s policies and ideas, one may be curious about what it is like to be such a controversial figure on social media and what kind of posts receive the most attention. This web application aims to offer its users the opportunity to hypothetically post tweets in the shoes of Mr. Trump and see the number of favorites and retweets they could expect to get. After having fun trying different tweets on the app, the users would hopefully think a little more about the controversial and inciting nature of social media posts.

### Mission
The final web app would enable the user to enter a tweet—a small paragraph with less than 280 characters. After the user finishes, the app would output the predicted number of retweets and favorites if Mr. Trump tweeted the message.

The most crucial step in this project is to train a model using Mr. Trump’s previous tweets’ retweets and favorites statistics. The dataset I selected is collected and published on Kaggle by Austin Reese (https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/trump-tweets). For data pre-processing and model architecture, I expect to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including but not limited to tokenization, embeddings, and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The final model would take a string of any length smaller than 280 characters as an input and output the predicted retweets and favorites numbers.

It is also worthy of mentioning that the model developed in this project is readily applicable to social media strategy making. It is easy to retrain the model using a new celebrity or policy maker’s social media data. Then, before the user and his/her social media team publish a new post, they can use the application to select the appropriate topic and wording that would attract the most attention. This possibility is not part of my core vision but makes monetization reasonably easy.

### Success criteria

#### Machine learning performance metric

I think Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is a good metric for the machine learning model. For example, if the model predicts 1.2 million favorites/retweets for a tweet with 1 million favorites/retweets, the Absolute Percentage Error for this point is 20%. I expect predicting the number of retweets and favorites using only tweet content to be a relatively challenging problem since many other factors determine retweets and favorites, such as time of the day and recent events. Thus, I am willing to view a MAPE smaller than 40% as an indication that a model is ready to go live. Although R-squared is also a standard metric for a regression problem like this one, I decide to use MAPE because it is much easier to explain to non-technical audiences.

#### Business outcome metric

Since the web app’s purpose is to create a fun user experience, Daily Active User (DAU) is a great metric to measure user engagement. I expect most users to be one-time users, but I am not worried about growth. Many users will likely share screenshots of their creative tweets on social media and thus introduce more users to the app, creating a positive feedback loop. If the DAU reaches a level high enough, it is reasonable to monetize via advertisements.

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
